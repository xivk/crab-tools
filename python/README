This will create one (huge) csv file in your current folder {crab.csv} containing only the addressing information and their corresponding locations (lat/lon) already transformed from the lambert82 projection from AGIV.


Also one file is written per postal code {XXXX.csv} to make the information more managable and to get you started quickly. 

Current problems: some encodings of the street names!

The lambert module can be used to convert x-y coordinates into lat/lon.
